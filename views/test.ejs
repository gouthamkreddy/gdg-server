<p>Napoleon had an extensive and powerful influence on the modern world, bringing liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Countries">Low Countries</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and large parts of modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany">Germany</a>. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.[He established a system of public education,{{sfnGrab2003page=56] abolished the vestiges of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feudalism">feudalism</a>,(ref: Broers)<em>The Napoleonic Empire and the New European Political Culture</em>.

To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the fall of the Roman Empire."<ref>Andrew Roberts, <em>Napoleon: A Life</em> (2014), p. xxxiii.</ref></p>
<p>Napoleon was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsica">Corsica</a> to a relatively modest family from the minor nobility. He supported the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution">French Revolution</a> from the outset while serving in the French army, and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly through the ranks during the Revolution, ending up as commander of the Army of Italy after saving the governing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Directory">Directory</a> by suppressing a  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13_Vendémiaire">revolt from royalist insurgents</a>. At age 26, he began his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_campaigns_of_the_French_Revolutionary_Wars">first military campaign</a> against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring a series of decisive victories, conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year, and becoming a national hero. In 1798, he led a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_campaign_in_Egypt_and_Syria">military expedition to Egypt</a> that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_of_18_Brumaire">coup in November 1799</a> and became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Consulate">First Consul</a> of the Republic. His rising ambition inspired him to go further, and in 1804 he became the first <em>Emperor of the French</em>. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Third_Coalition">Third Coalition</a> by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulm_Campaign">Ulm Campaign</a> and a historic triumph at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a>, which led to the elimination of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. In 1806, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Fourth_Coalition">Fourth Coalition</a> took up arms against him because Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly knocked out Prussia at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jena–Auerstedt">battles of Jena and Auerstedt</a>, then marched the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Armée">Grand Army</a> deep into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, annihilating the Russians in June 1807 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Friedland">at Friedland</a> and forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaties_of_Tilsit">Treaties of Tilsit</a>. Tilsit signified the high watermark of the French Empire. In 1809, the Austrians challenged the French again during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Fifth_Coalition">War of the Fifth Coalition</a>, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wagram">Battle of Wagram</a> in July 1809.</p>
<p>Hoping to extend the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_System">Continental System</a> meant to choke off British goods from the European mainland, Napoleon invaded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula">Iberia</a> and declared his brother <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bonaparte">Joseph</a> the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_War">Peninsular War</a> lasted six years, featured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guerrilla_warfare">guerrilla warfare</a>, and ended in victory for the Allies. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its allies, especially Russia. Unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, the Russians violated the Continental System and enticed Napoleon into war. The French launched an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia">invasion of Russia</a> in the summer of 1812. The campaign witnessed the collapse of the Grand Army, the destruction of Russian lands and cities, and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Coalition">Sixth Coalition</a> against France. A military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Leipzig">Battle of Leipzig</a> in October 1813. The Allies then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1814_campaign_in_France">invaded France</a> and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elba">Elba</a> near Rome and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_dynasty">Bourbons</a> were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_restoration">restored to power</a>. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Seventh_Coalition">Seventh Coalition</a>, which defeated Napoleon at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> in June. The British exiled him to the remote island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Helena">Saint Helena</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">South Atlantic</a>, where he spent the remainder of his years. His death in 1821 at the age of 51 was received with surprise, shock and grief throughout Europe and left a memory that still persists.<ref><span class="reference" data-type="book" data-author="John Sainsbury" data-url="http://books.google.com/books?id" data-year="1842" data-location="London" data-page="15">Sketch of the Napoleon Museum</span></ref><ref><span class="reference" data-type="book" data-author="Philip Ingram" data-url="http://books.google.com/books?id" data-year="1998" data-publisher="Nelson Thornes" data-pages="47–49">Napoleon and Europe</span></ref></p>
